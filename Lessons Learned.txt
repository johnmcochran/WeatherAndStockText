getting airflow to work

    used astro cli, created a blank project with astro dev init, then copied those files into my repos
    put modules in same folder as dag so that it was easier to import
    need __init__.py in all folders with python files that need to be read

    use astro dev start/restart to push changes
    if it seems like nothing is making sense after pushing a change, try astro dev kill followed by start

AWS secrets manager
    need credentials to use boto3
    need the user's access key id and secret access key
    use json library to convert AWS response to dictionary, otherwise, just copy code given by AWS
